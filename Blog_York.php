	It was a changeable weather as usual in England, was a perfect day for my hoodie. When a sky turned into a pastel colour tone of blue with a pure white cotton candy, I met a first interviewee in Deans Park, York.<br>
	
	A lovely girl I spoke for the video above, she was hiding half of her body behind her family. I asked her ‘when do you miss home the most?’, ‘have you ever missed home?’ then she answered,<br>
	
	‘When I was on a train’.<br>
	
	I truly believe that all generations could have a strong empathy with the young lady’s answer. It was absolutely clear to realise the point when we start thinking about Home.<br>
	
	The city, York is a completely gorgeous town for a one day picnic. My first visit had quite tight schedule to enjoy York International Short Film Festival, so I needed to plan for the second visit. The town has a lot of precious spots to look around, especially The Shamble, one of oldest streets in York, is famous for a representative location of a series film, Harry Potter.<br>

	The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination.<br>
	
	Sometimes when I was overwhelmed these historic spots during the picnic, I felt that I am being completely one of the tourists. In the other words, when I got surrounded by all new things, I recognised that I was away from my space.<br>

	Yes, the moment we start travelling.<br>
	
	I assume that a train has a mysterious power to make people isolate themselves. All passengers share the space together, but they completely become alone. It reminds me of home at that moment I switch moods to jump into an unknown world. Ironically, we might think about home when we’ve just left our home rather than while we are at home. It does not matter whether the journey is short or longer.<br><br>
	
	What is HOME made of? Family? Friends? or Safe place?<br><br>
	
	Many interviewees answered with these words for my question, “what does home mean to you”. Nevertheless It is still hard to pick an accurate word to describe it, but it could be ‘somewhere’ to go back from at least a short trip for sure. Such as ‘Home sweet home’. Because unknown cities bring very spontaneous stimulation to remind the people of any kind of their own familiar sights.<br>
	
	However, what if the journey would be longer? What if the people decide not to come back. How could we meet ‘the somewhere’ from the unknown cities?<br><br><br>
